# ATP_prediction
Exploring the capabilities of some ML models as well as simple Multi Perceptron Neural Net to predict results of the tennis ATP matches .


Since there are not any good patterns in sportsmen performance, ML models aren't supposed to give a good accuracy. Hence the metrics that I use
is a money you can gain betting on the matches on the models' advice. Even though all the data can be used to predict a single match winner, 
I am using just the data containing past matches of only first or second player of the match we are trying to predict.
